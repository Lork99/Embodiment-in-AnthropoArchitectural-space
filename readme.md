# Embodiment in AntropoArchitectural space
Human beings as multi-sensory receptor organisms 
have an expanded range of ways by which they 
experience life. This seemingly brings out 
complication in the sphere of designing due 
to not enough research on that topic. 
Understanding the processes that correspond with 
the experience of either built or natural environment 
are the key to creating “embodying space” singular in 
our AnthropoArchitecturally existent environment. 
It would be a gift from humanity to humanity to pay 
attention and investigate the stimuli that are inherent 
parts of our day-to-day reality and as a result influence 
architectural practice which is full of shortcomings. 
How we react to space matters. How we learn from space matters. 
How we coexist with other people in space matters. All of our 
spheres of understanding the world around us and the world 
inside us come from our body in its whole with no taking it 
apart to pieces and calling one piece more important than the 
other. Simultaneous cooperation of the fragments of the body is 
key and yet bit by bit we carve out the world we build for 
ourselves and take away the stimuli that corresponds to each 
and every fragment of our bodies. We take from ourselves the 
experiences that would enrich our own lives. Our actions are 
body-sabotaging. Why? How? By investing in some senses more than 
others and hence overstimulating ourselves, e.g. visually and 
auditorily. Whereas sensory understimulation is visible with the 
underrated senses like touch. It’s time we realise that the 
distinction between body and spirit doesn’t mean that one can work 
without the other. Mens sana in corpore sano/ “A healthy mind in a 
healthy body” is an old Latin proverb but couldn’t be more accurate 
these days. This is why I urge for recognition of this phrase in our 
understanding of spatial reality and its design. Clearly, what we need 
is balance and to pay more attention in relation to design and to keep 
in mind the recipient of the spatial reality we seek to create. 
Otherwise, reality hits us hard with diseases as a result of blindness to sensism. 
Stop the ignorance of the body, stop the arrogance towards its parts, 
stop assigning the “most important roles” to pieces of the body. 
This is a call for multisensory AnthropoArchitectural design which 
places the body, the recipient at the focus of the design.  

To clarify by embodiment in this essay I mean experiencing through 
all the five senses with the emphasised role that is played by the 
body as the main organ for senses. Its role has been as underestimated 
as the part that touch plays in our experience of spatial reality. 
Skin is full of receptors which through contact create an image of the 
surroundings often more true than known through other senses alone. 
Yet the ideal situation is multisensory reliance which results in the
most accurate representation.

To give an overview, I’m going to get to the topic of senses a little 
further in order to analyse them and their influence on our day-to-day 
perception. To highlight their part and then direct attention to an 
incomprehensible lack of their combined potential when applied to the 
design process. As human beings we are visually dominant creatures 
which can be supported by Heilig’s study where he assigns 70% to sight 
when it comes to our captured attention. The next senses go as follows: 
20% to audition, 5% to olfaction, 4% to touch and only 1% to taste. 
Following Hegel’s work on senses, he makes a distinction between desire 
and contemplation and where he appoints them. For smell, taste and touch 
since they’re seemingly impossible to unlink from pleasure they are 
acknowledged as part of desire. In contrast to that he sets hearing and 
vision and links them to contemplation. He explains that the difference 
between the two is that desire is connected with the need to possess and 
consume whereas contemplation means leaving something free and being more 
interested in the concept of it. Hegel recognizes the spirit as the realm 
of cognition and presents the appreciation of appearance and detachment 
from material that we have for artwork as the echo of the spirit. Another 
take on senses worth mentioning is that of Sidney Zink. Her focus is on 
esthetic appreciation and sense pleasure and their differences. She recognizes
the importance of concentration on the object of pleasure for full satisfaction, 
it is emphasised though that this kind of participation is passive. In aesthetic 
appreciation it is highlighted that there’s a need for active participation and 
examination in order to get a full experience. Again, we meet the distinction 
which recognizes vision and hearing as the elevating senses and the other ones 
as lesser and hedonistic. It is time to explore the underrated, more body than 
spirit senses and recognize their life-changing influence. I call for recognition 
of the excluded senses. I call for rejection of the outdated and backward 
understanding of senses and re-assigning them their part in design practice. 

Going to the basics and following empiricist philosophy, it’s important to 
recognize that as children we learn mostly through touch - it being the learning organ. 
The Montessori method of education focuses on the importance of self-exploration of 
surroundings, the tactile examination prompts the processing of structures of reality. 
A lot of the time in order for us to grasp a concept we need to live through it. 
The key to understanding the surrounding us environment is in experiencing it through 
all the senses. But as all of us are different, our learning also differs from one to 
another. The recognized learning types are auditory (through hearing and listening), 
visual (by reading or seeing pictures) and tactile (by touching and doing). In conclusion, 
I believe that the utopian built environment would accommodate the need for multisensory 
stimuli for self-growth. As for now in architecture the most focus is put on the visionary 
experience of the place. I think that by expanding to other senses places can become more 
inclusive on the basis of the simple relationship between the human body and artificial 
bodies of architecture. Let us constantly and almost effortlessly learn from what surrounds us. 

Nancy Diniz in her work “Body Tailored Space: Configuring Space through Embodiment” 
calls for embodiment to have an active part in reconsidering the future reality. She 
self-explains about her project that the main thesis is for designers to use the body 
as an interface to understand how the interaction between a person and his/her surroundings 
arises and how our embodiment reveals other rich spatial qualities during the conception 
phase of design. Probably the most important reference in the text is Maurice Merleau-Ponty 
with his rejection of Husserl’s study. Husserl as the father of Phenomenology followed 
Cartesian dualism - the idea (...) of separation of mind and body. On the other hand, 
Merleau-Ponty completely reworks the approach to body and mind and explains the active 
role of the body in human experience. Body Tailored Space is an example of what could 
be developed into an architectural practice’s sphere known as interactive design. It 
gives the opportunity not only to study how the body acts in space but also how that 
can be reinterpreted by the surroundings which would create a simultaneous relationship 
between living organisms and artificially enhanced non-living objects. This research is 
a few steps in the future to the reality that we encounter. Architectural practice 
needs to be influenced by Anthropology. Embodiment is just one of the characteristics 
that the working together of Architecture and Anthropology would bring. Body Tailored 
space teaches us that by using artificial intelligence we can map with more ease how 
people use and react in spatial reality. 
The saying that I want to focus on now is “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”. It 
is not to say that sight is the most important sense and hence contradict myself but 
to underline the role of the beholder. The being that cannot be duplicated to another 
being, beholder is other to any of its kind. We’re all individuals with a set of 
characteristics e.g. the mentioned earlier ways of learning that we share with other 
people. It feels like in modern approaches to life we are all targeted as the response 
team without which the tested alternatives to domains cannot be assessed and later on 
incorporated if successful. Even though I can’t help but wonder if the growth has 
strayed from the right path to a favourable outcome. The body in modern times has 
become too objectified to roam freely. The space overrides limitations to the form 
it was supposed to accommodate. I understand the challenges of the architectural 
profession which is why I call for a wide collaboration in the field of making our 
spatial reality a safe space in which bodies feel safe. In which embodiment is part 
of the designing process. In which Anthropology merges its forces with Architecture. 

As a means of summary I would like to quote Peter Zumthor from his work “Atmospheres”
 which focuses on the importance of addressing the body of architecture “To me it's 
the kind of anatomy we are talking about. (...) The body! Not the idea of the body -  
the body itself! A body that can touch me.” We should embrace the term embodiment and 
rework it to create other that responds to the body of architecture. What this would 
allow is for human and architectural forms to come into interplay with each other. 
It will allow for a kind of symbiosis between the two. In this sense the other would 
be an extension that came to be by the process of abjection with the outcome of creating 
a conceptual pair. By this definition the embodiment of architecture could be assigned 
the characteristics that Peter Zumthor explores in his work on Atmospheres where he focuses 
on the emotions that spaces bring him. What is important is that in at least one of the 
descriptions he mentions that the atmosphere of the place is influenced by the human 
interaction observed there. Following Zumthor would be the first step to exploring senses 
and their importance in “touching” the space. The few suggestions are to concentrate on 
the magic of the real, material compatibility, the sound of a space, the temperature of 
a space, surrounding objects, between composure and seduction, tension between interior 
and exterior, the light on things, coherence, the beautiful form and finally architecture as surroundings. 

Through embodiment can we only truly react to space and hence the next step of evolution for 
AnthropoArchitecture has to be to put in the past the division of understanding bodies. 
Let us create forms and realities that through vision can be felt as if touched. Let us get out 
of limitations of learning from our surroundings through somatic or semi-somatic contact. 
Let us understand the opportunities rather than limitations of understanding the human scale experience of the built environment.
